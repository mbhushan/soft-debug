Five Rules for Bad Software Debugging:
======================================

* Scatter output statements everywhere.

* Debug program into existence - add/remove statements till it comes into existence

* Never backup earlier versions of the program - who can't remember what they wrote some 5-10 minutes ago.

* Don't bother understanding what program should do - "Time is a luxury we do not have" - that kind of killer stuff.

* Use the most obvious fix - lets fix the symptop first rather than "wondering" about the problem. Again - who the fuck has time :) - Rumor has it that some programmer use premature return statements to make some unit tests work.
